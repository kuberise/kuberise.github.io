# How to enable or disable platform tools

For each platform there is a values-[platformName].yaml in app-of-apps folder. This value file is merged and override the default values.yaml file in that folder. The default values.yaml file contains a list of all integrated tools and services in this repository and all of them are disabled. Then in each platform specific values file which is values-[platformName].yaml, we define which tool to install by making `enabled: true`
